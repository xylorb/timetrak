# TimeTrak PWA #

This is a time tracking PWA (progressive web application) with the purpose of tracking time spent doing a particular task (for example, a work day).

On a personal note, it aslo serves as a general web application template, PWA template, and plain old practice for the author.

This project started using a very helpful [template from 
codepo8](https://github.com/codepo8/github-page-pwa).
